        <h1>Personal Manifesto , Altruistic, Sustainable Tech</h1>
        <p class="lead">A short, honest statement of values, hopes, and ideas about where we are as a species and where our science, technology & engineering should go.</p>
      </header>  <section>
    <h2>Where I stand</h2>
    <p>I'm disappointed by where we are as a species, where we are heading. Our primal instincts are overtaking reasoning and instead of optimizing for sustainability, wellbeing, health, meaning, impact, curiosity, altruism, we are falling short to greed, consumerism, the chase for more and meaningless monkey capitalism.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>My focus: STEM & technology</h2>
    <p>I'm particularly saddened by our STEM state. I think what I'm saying applies to a lot more, but this is my passion and domain. Are we in science, tech & engineering optimizing for the environment? For fellow human beings' wellbeing and health? For future generations? For curiosity, altruism and sustainability?</p>
    <p>It seems that all we do is capitalize profits, consume more, and disregard the ecosystem. Take social media, technology is supposed to make our life better. It must be net good in the mentioned criteria, but we optimize for ad revenue and user retention while disregarding user wellbeing and health.</p>

    <h2>Is your software as wholesome as <code>ls</code>?</h2>
    <div class="ls-compare">
      <p>Think about <code>ls</code> for a second: it lists what you ask for, it does not ask for anything back. It doesn't try to keep you glued, it doesn't sell you stuff, and it doesn't whisper "more" into your attention span.</p>
      <p>Does your app do that? Or does it behave like a needy circus performer — juggling notifications, fishing for clicks, and quietly harvesting your data while promising you happiness next quarter?</p>
      <p><strong>ls</strong> is wholesome on purpose: it respects your time, respects your attention, and is quietly useful. If your software can't be as straightforward as <code>ls</code>, maybe it should come with a warning label: "May distract, track, or guilt you into buying things you don't need."</p>
      <p>Ask yourself: would I rather build products that act like <code>ls</code>, or products that act like attention kleptos? There is nothing boring about usefulness — it's radical care.</p>
    </div>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>Questions I can't stop asking</h2>
    <ul class="values">
      <li>Why not optimize for wellbeing first and foremost, and keep profits healthy and reasonable?</li>
      <li>Why the greed, why the push for more?</li>
      <li>Why has the experience and joy of computing and problem solving been reduced to capitalist B2B utilities that maximize consumption and make the environment and end users worse off?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>A different path</h2>
    <p>I propose a new initiative in my domain: altruistic, sustainability-positive, impact-driven development. Development that values sustainability, wellbeing, health, curiosity and altruism as first principles, with healthy, acceptable profits as a constraint, not the north star.</p>
    <p>I'm not against commodities or business, but let's design systems, platforms and products whose primary optimization is for human and ecological flourishing, not for endless growth at any cost.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>Values (short)</h2>
    <ul class="values">
      <li>Sustainability</li>
      <li>Wellbeing & health</li>
      <li>Meaningful impact</li>
      <li>Curiosity & learning</li>
      <li>Altruism</li>
      <li>Responsible profit (enough, not endless)</li>
    </ul>
