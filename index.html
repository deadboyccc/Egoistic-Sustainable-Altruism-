        <h1>Personal Manifesto , Altruistic, Sustainable Tech</h1>
        <p class="lead">A concise statement of values, hopes, and ideas about where we are as a species and where our science, technology and engineering should go.</p>
      </header>  <section>
    <h2>Where I stand</h2>
    <p>I'm disappointed by where we are as a species and where we are heading. Our primal instincts are overtaking reasoning and, instead of optimizing for sustainability, wellbeing, health, meaning, impact and curiosity, we prioritize greed, consumerism, and the chase for more — meaningless monkey capitalism.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>My focus: STEM and technology</h2>
    <p>I'm especially saddened by the state of STEM. This is my passion and domain. Are we in science, tech and engineering optimizing for the environment, for human wellbeing and health, for future generations, for curiosity, altruism and sustainability?</p>
    <p>Too often we capitalize profits, consume more, and disregard the ecosystem. Technology should make life better: it should be net good for people and planet. Yet we optimize for ad revenue and retention while disregarding user wellbeing.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>Is your software as wholesome as <code>ls</code>?</h2>
    <div class="ls-compare">
      <p>Consider <code>ls</code>. It lists what you ask for, and it does nothing else: it is predictable, transparent, and respectful of your time. It does not try to keep you engaged, sell you products, or collect your data to boost revenue.</p>
      <p>Good software should behave similarly: respect attention, avoid manipulative retention tactics, and protect personal data. It's not just about malicious data harvesting and attention capture; it's also about the constant pressure to increase profits and consumption, draining our systems and environments for more meaningless monkey business.</p>
      <p>If a product prioritizes retention, ads, or relentless growth over people and the planet, it fails a basic test of care. Usefulness that respects people and ecosystems is not dull — it is responsible design.</p>
    </div>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>Questions I keep asking</h2>
    <ul class="values">
      <li>Why not optimize for wellbeing first, and keep profits healthy and reasonable?</li>
      <li>Why the greed, why the push for more?</li>
      <li>Why has the joy of computing and problem solving been reduced to B2B utilities that maximize consumption and harm users and the environment?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>A different path</h2>
    <p>I propose an initiative in my domain: altruistic, sustainability-positive, impact-driven development. Development that treats sustainability, wellbeing, health, curiosity and altruism as first principles, with healthy profits as a constraint rather than the goal.</p>
    <p>I'm not against business, but let's design systems, platforms and products that optimize for human and ecological flourishing, not endless growth at any cost.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>Values (short)</h2>
    <ul class="values">
      <li>Sustainability</li>
      <li>Wellbeing and health</li>
      <li>Meaningful impact</li>
      <li>Curiosity and learning</li>
      <li>Altruism</li>
      <li>Responsible profit (enough, not endless)</li>
    </ul>
